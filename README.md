# Production Calculator Test

## Overview

This project is a simple web application designed to display the number 600 within a designated result area. It utilizes Bootstrap for styling to ensure a clean and responsive user interface.

## Features

*   Displays a fixed value of "600" in the result section.
*   Employs Bootstrap for modern and responsive styling.
*   Provides a clear and straightforward user experience.

## Usage

To use this application, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The number 600 will be immediately visible, styled according to the Bootstrap framework.

## Technical Details

The core functionality is achieved through a simple HTML structure. The number 600 is placed within a `div` element with a specific ID (`#result`). Bootstrap's CSS framework is included via a CDN link in the HTML's `<head>` section, providing pre-built styles for layout and presentation. No JavaScript is required for this basic display.
